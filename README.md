## Introduction

The course completes students' skills in the area of coding by presenting software development techniques based on the Object-Oriented paradigm. The Java programming language is analyzed in detail and used to exemplify the OO concepts; mentions of alternative solutions, such as the ones adopted in C++ and Python, are also sketched.

In this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming principles and techniques. The labs and exams included in this repository showcase my proficiency in applying these concepts to real-world programming challenges.

## Laboratories

The `LabXX` directory contains the solutions to various laboratory assignments throughout the course. Each lab focuses on specific aspects of object-oriented programming, such as class design, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. 

## Exams

The `ExamXXXXXXXX` directory hosts my solutions to the final exams conducted as part of the course. These exams required me to synthesize my knowledge and skills acquired throughout the semester to solve complex programming problems.

## Usage

To explore the labs and exam solutions, simply navigate to the respective directories. Each directory contains the source code files along with any necessary documentation or additional resources. 

Feel free to adapt, modify, or enhance the code according to your needs. If you find these solutions helpful, don't forget to give this repository a star!
